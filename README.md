# lefiAPI
This API aims to show informations about myself.

# Browse
The [current release](https://k4kyrw.deta.dev/docs) is hosted on [deta](https://www.deta.sh/)

# Get started
This is a [fastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) project, therefore, after having [installed it](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/),  run a local version of it in command line with ```uvicorn main:app --reload```

## Export
Thanks to deta, the export is quite simple, I have just to type ```deta deploy``` or ```deta watch ``` in order to update the changes online.
